# About

Gym Bro - A person whose personality and lifestyle are heavily influenced by the gym. All of their life choices usually revolve around lifting and proper nutrition. - Urban Dictionary 

Macronutrients aka macros are essential to the gym bro. Macros include protein (most important), carbohydrates and fats.  

Check Your macros is an app where you eneter the barcode of a food package and it returns the percentage makeup of the macros in a food as well as the calories per 100g or per 100ml

## How to use App 

In the input search-box enter the product barcode and click search. If the product is not found, you'll get an error message saying product not found. Otherwise you will recieve the following four data points: Calories per 100g or per 100ml of the product as well as the total volumes, as a percentage, of each macronutrient (Protein, Carbohydrate and Fat)

## API Used
I mainly used the Open Food Facts database for this project. Documentation can be found here:

https://openfoodfacts.github.io/api-documentation/

General information about the API from the documentation homepage:

As a developer, the Open Food Facts API allows you to get information about existing products and contribute to the products database.

Using the API, you can create apps to help people make better food choices and also provide data to enhance the database.

Check out how others are making use of the API at https://world.openfoodfacts.org/discover#reuses.

## Optimizations

I could improve on the app by optimizing the page for different screen sizes. I can also figure out way to ustilise a camera app on a mobile device to scan the barcode a conduct the same search.
